# TestTask

1.	Create an HTML page that displays the data from the attached JSON file in a grid. Each row of a grid must display the image (image link is in imageUrl field in the JSON) and object name (“name” in the JSON)

2.	Each grid row should be selectable; the selected objects must be highlighted. By default, no objects are selected.

3.	“Submit” button should be placed under the grid. The button must be centered horizontally.

4.	When Submit button is clicked, it must display the IDs of the selected grid elements using alert() function.

5.	The solution must use at least minimal CSS styles – spacing between grid rows, style for Submit button, etc.
